I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at Yale University. My dissertation research concerns public attitudes toward nuclear technologies. My general research interests relate to political behavior, and especially to the microfoundations of state behavior in international relations.

I am also interested in approaches that streamline and establish standard practice for principled, reproducible research in the social sciences. To this end, I am working with [Molly Offer-Westort](https://mollyow.github.io) and the Aronow Research Lab to produce a set of standard operating procedures and checklists for effective research practices.
